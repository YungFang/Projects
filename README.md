# Projects
Code for Tina's data cleaning and visualizations.

1. NNIS_Rural-Urban_Mammogram use
- NNIS (National Health Interview Survey), 2021-2023, women aged 40-74 years
- I conducted descriptive analyses to calculate the prevalence of mammography use for each exposure group, overall and by multiple sociodemogrphic factors. Linear risk regression models were used to assess rural-urban disparities in mammography utilization. These models calculated prevalence differences, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values, comparing to the referent group of the large central/fringe metro.
- Results were present by tables and figures. Data visualization was made via R studio.
- Forest plot for stratified anlayses: ![stratified_analysis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff86d704-97d8-4cd5-90bb-ea33b45ca665)
